        GConf comes with a GSettings backend that can be used to
        facility the transition to the GSettings API until you are
        ready to make the jump to a different backend (most likely
        dconf). To use it, you need to set the <code class="envar">GSETTINGS_BACKEND</code>
        to 'gconf', e.g. by using
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  g_setenv ("GSETTINGS_BACKEND", "gconf", TRUE);
</pre>
<p>
        early on in your program. Note that this backend is meant purely
        as a transition tool, and should not be used in production.
      </p>
<p>
        GConf also comes with a utility called
        <span class="command"><strong>gsettings-data-convert</strong></span>, which is designed to help
        with the task of migrating user settings from GConf into another
        GSettings backend. It can be run manually, but it is designed to be
        executed automatically, every time a user logs in. It keeps track of
        the data migrations that it has already done, and it is harmless to
        run it more than once.
      </p>
<p>
        To make use of this utility, you must install a keyfile in the
        directory <code class="filename">/usr/share/GConf/gsettings</code> which
        lists the GSettings keys and GConf paths to map to each other, for
        each schema that you want to migrate user data for.
      </p>
<p>
        Here is an example:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">

[org.gnome.fonts]
antialiasing = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/antialiasing
dpi = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/dpi
hinting = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/hinting
rgba-order = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/rgba_order

[apps.myapp:/path/to/myapps/]
some-odd-key1 = /apps/myapp/some_ODD-key1

        </pre>
<p>
        The last key demonstrates that it may be necessary to modify the key
        name to comply with stricter GSettings key name rules. Of course,
        that means your application must use the new key names when looking
        up settings in GSettings.
      </p>
<p>
        The last group in the example also shows how to handle the case
        of 'relocatable' schemas, which don't have a fixed path. You can
        specify the path to use in the group name, separated by a colon.
      </p>
<p>
        There are some limitations: <span class="command"><strong>gsettings-data-convert</strong></span>
        does not do any transformation of the values. And it does not handle
        complex GConf types other than lists of strings or integers.
      </p>
<p>
        Don't forget to require GConf 2.31.1 or newer in your configure
        script if you are making use of the GConf backend or the conversion
        utility.
      </p>
<p>
        If, as an application developer, you are interested in manually
        ensuring that <span class="command"><strong>gsettings-data-convert</strong></span> has been
        invoked (for example, to deal with the case where the user is
        logged in during a distribution upgrade or for non-XDG desktop
        environments which do not run the command as an autostart) you
        may invoke it manually during your program initialisation.  This
        is not recommended for all application authors -- it is your
        choice if this use case concerns you enough.
      </p>
<p>
        Internally, <span class="command"><strong>gsettings-data-convert</strong></span> uses a
        keyfile to track which settings have been migrated.  The
        following code fragment will check that keyfile to see if your
        data conversion script has been run yet and, if not, will
        attempt to invoke the tool to run it.  You should adapt it to
        your application as you see fit.
      </p>
<p>
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">

static void
ensure_migrated (const gchar *name)
{
  gboolean needed = TRUE;
  GKeyFile *kf;
  gchar **list;
  gsize i, n;

  kf = g_key_file_new ();

  g_key_file_load_from_data_dirs (kf, "gsettings-data-convert",
                                  NULL, G_KEY_FILE_NONE, NULL);
  list = g_key_file_get_string_list (kf, "State", "converted", &amp;n, NULL);

  if (list)
    {
      for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        if (strcmp (list[i], name) == 0)
          {
            needed = FALSE;
            break;
          }

      g_strfreev (list);

  if (needed)

}


        </pre>
<p>
      </p>
<p>
        Although there is the possibility that the
        <span class="command"><strong>gsettings-data-convert</strong></span> script will end up
        running multiple times concurrently with this approach, it is
        believed that this is safe.
