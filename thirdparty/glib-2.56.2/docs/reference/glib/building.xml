    <title>Building the Library on UNIX</title>
    <para>
      On UNIX, GLib uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <application>autoconf</application> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <application>automake</application> for building makefiles
      that comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <application>libtool</application> for building shared
      libraries on multiple platforms.  The normal sequence for
      compiling and installing the GLib library is thus:

      <literallayout>
        <userinput>./configure</userinput>
        <userinput>make</userinput>
        <userinput>make install</userinput>
      </literallayout>
    </para>

    <para>
      The standard options provided by <application>GNU
      autoconf</application> may be passed to the
      <command>configure</command> script.  Please see the
      <application>autoconf</application> documentation or run
      <command>./configure --help</command> for information about
      the standard options.

      GLib is compiled with

      disabled. It is strongly recommended that this is not re-enabled by
      overriding the compiler flags, as GLib has not been tested with strict
      aliasing and cannot be guaranteed to work.

      Before you can compile the GLib library, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your system.
      If you are building from a release archive, you will need
      <ulink url="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib/CompilerRequirements">a compliant C toolchain</ulink>,
      GNU Make, and <application>pkg-config</application>;
      if you are building directly from a Git repository clone
      of GLib, you will also need the GNU Autotools mentioned
      above.

          libraries that are used by the GLib library. (For each

      A UNIX build of GLib requires that the system implements at
      least the original 1990 version of POSIX. Beyond this, it
      depends on a number of other libraries.

          The <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">GNU
          libiconv library</ulink> is needed to build GLib if your
          system doesn't have the <function>iconv()</function>
          function for doing conversion between character
          encodings. Most modern systems should have
          <function>iconv()</function>, however many older systems lack
          an <function>iconv()</function> implementation. On such systems,
          you must install the libiconv library. This can be found at:
          <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv">http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv</ulink>.
        </para>
        <para>
          If your system has an <function>iconv()</function> implementation but
          you want to use libiconv instead, you can pass the
          <option>--with-libiconv</option> option to configure. This forces
          libiconv to be used.
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that if you have libiconv installed in your default include
          search path (for instance, in <filename>/usr/local/</filename>), but
          don't enable it, you will get an error while compiling GLib because
          the <filename>iconv.h</filename> that libiconv installs hides the
          system iconv.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you are using the native iconv implementation on Solaris
          instead of libiconv, you'll need to make sure that you have
          the converters between locale encodings and UTF-8 installed.
          At a minimum you'll need the SUNWuiu8 package. You probably
          should also install the SUNWciu8, SUNWhiu8, SUNWjiu8, and
          SUNWkiu8 packages.

        <para>
          The native iconv on Compaq Tru64 doesn't contain support for
          UTF-8, so you'll need to use GNU libiconv instead. (When
          using GNU libiconv for GLib, you'll need to use GNU libiconv
          for GNU gettext as well.) This probably applies to related
          operating systems as well.

          the system version is too old, or does not support UTF-8; the internal

        Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to 'no'

        <function>g_return_val_if_fail()</function> and all cast checks
        between different object types. Setting it to 'minimum' disables
        only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables <link linkend="G-DEBUG:CAPS">runtime debugging</link>.
        The default is 'minimum' for stable releases, and 'yes' for development
        snapshots. Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize
        even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs
        from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus

      <para>
        By default, and with <option>--disable-gc-friendly</option>
        as well, GLib does not clear the memory for certain objects before
        they are freed. For example, GLib may decide to recycle GList nodes
        by putting them in a free list. However, memory profiling and debugging
        tools like <ulink url="http://www.valgrind.org">Valgrind</ulink> work
        better if an application does not keep dangling pointers to freed
        memory (even though these pointers are no longer dereferenced), or
        invalid pointers inside uninitialized memory.
        The <option>--enable-gc-friendly</option> option makes GLib
        clear memory in these situations:

            When shrinking a GArray, GLib will clear the memory no longer
            available in the array: shrink an array from 10 bytes to 7, and

      <para>
        Many small chunks of memory are often allocated via collective pools
        in GLib and are cached after release to speed up reallocations.
        For sparse memory systems this behaviour is often inferior, so
        memory pools can be disabled to avoid excessive caching and force
        atomic maintenance of chunks through the <function>g_malloc()</function>
        and <function>g_free()</function> functions. Code currently affected by

        By default the <command>configure</command> script will try

        internal uses of GLib functions with
        <envar>LD_PRELOAD</envar>. Therefore, it may make
        sense to turn this feature off in some situations.

        auto-detect if libselinux is available and include
        SELinux support in GIO if it is. These options can be
        used to explicitly control whether SELinux support should
        be included.

      <title><option>--disable-dtrace</option> and
        <option>--enable-dtrace</option></title>

      <para>
        By default the <command>configure</command> script will
        detect if DTrace support is available, and use it.

    <formalpara>
      <title><option>--disable-systemtap</option> and
        <option>--enable-systemtap</option></title>

      <para>
        This option requires DTrace support. If it is available, then
        the <command>configure</command> script will also check for
        the presence of SystemTap.

    <formalpara>
      <title><option>--enable-coverage</option> and
        <option>--disable-coverage</option></title>

      <para>
        Enable the generation of coverage reports for the GLib tests.
        This requires the lcov frontend to gcov from the
        <ulink url="http://ltp.sourceforge.net">Linux Test Project</ulink>.
        To generate a coverage report, use the lcov make target. The
        report is placed in the <filename>glib-lcov</filename> directory.

    <formalpara>
      <title><option>--with-runtime-libdir=RELPATH</option></title>

      <para>
        Allows specifying a relative path to where to install the runtime
        libraries (meaning library files used for running, not developing,
        GLib applications). This can be used in operating system setups where
        programs using GLib needs to run before e.g. <filename>/usr</filename>
        is mounted.
        For example, if <varname>LIBDIR</varname> is <filename>/usr/lib</filename> and
        <filename>../../lib</filename> is passed to
        <option>--with-runtime-libdir</option> then the
        runtime libraries are installed into <filename>/lib</filename> rather
        than <filename>/usr/lib</filename>.
      </para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
      <title><option>--with-python=PATH</option></title>

      <para>
        Allows specifying the Python interpreter to use, either as an absolute path,
        or as a program name. GLib can be built with Python 2 (at least version 2.7)
        or, preferably, with Python 3.
