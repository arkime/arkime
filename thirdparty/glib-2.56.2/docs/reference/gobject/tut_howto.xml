<chapter id="howto-gobject">
  <title>How to define and implement a new GObject</title>
  
  <para>
    This chapter focuses on the implementation of a subtype of GObject, for
    example to create a custom class hierarchy, or to subclass a GTK+ widget.
  </para>

  <para>
    Throughout the chapter, a running example of a file viewer program is used,
    which has a <type>ViewerFile</type> class to represent a single file being
    viewed, and various derived classes for different types of files with
    special functionality, such as audio files. The example application also
    supports editing files (for example, to tweak a photo being viewed), using
    a <type>ViewerEditable</type> interface.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="howto-gobject-header">
    <title>Boilerplate header code</title>
    
    <para>
      The first step before writing the code for your GObject is to write the
      type's header which contains the needed type, function and macro
      definitions. Each of these elements is nothing but a convention which
      is followed by almost all users of GObject, and has been refined over
      multiple years of experience developing GObject-based code. If you are
      writing a library, it is particularly important for you to adhere closely
      to these conventions; users of your library will assume that you have.
      Even if not writing a library, it will help other people who want to work
      on your project.
    </para>

    <para>
      Pick a name convention for your headers and source code and stick to it:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>use a dash to separate the prefix from the typename:
        <filename>viewer-file.h</filename> and <filename>viewer-file.c</filename>
        (this is the convention used by Nautilus and most GNOME libraries).</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>use an underscore to separate the prefix from the
        typename: <filename>viewer_file.h</filename> and
        <filename>viewer_file.c</filename>.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Do not separate the prefix from the typename:
        <filename>viewerfile.h</filename> and <filename>viewerfile.c</filename>.
        (this is the convention used by GTK+)</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Some people like the first two solutions better: it makes reading file
      names easier for those with poor eyesight.
    </para>

    <para>
      The basic conventions for any header which exposes a GType are described
      in <xref linkend="gtype-conventions"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you want to declare a type named ‘file’ in namespace ‘viewer’, name the
      type instance <function>ViewerFile</function> and its class
      <function>ViewerFileClass</function> (names are case sensitive). The
      recommended method of declaring a type differs based on whether the type
      is final or derivable.
    </para>

    <para>
      Final types cannot be subclassed further, and should be the default choice
      for new types — changing a final type to be derivable is always a change
      that will be compatible with existing uses of the code, but the converse
      will often cause problems. Final types are declared using
      <link linkend="G-DECLARE-FINAL-TYPE:CAPS"><function>G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE</function></link>,
      and require a structure to hold the instance data to be declared in the
      source code (not the header file).

    <para>
      The convention for header includes is to add the minimum number of
      <function>#include</function> directives to the top of your headers needed
      to compile that header. This
      allows client code to simply <function>#include "viewer-file.h"</function>,

      <filename>viewer-file.h</filename>.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="howto-gobject-code">
    <title>Boilerplate code</title>

    <para>
      In your code, the first step is to <function>#include</function> the
      needed headers:

    <para>
      If the class is being declared as final using
      <function>G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE</function>, its instance structure should

    <para>
      Call the <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE</function> macro (or

      private data — final types do <emphasis>not</emphasis> need private data)
      using the name
      of the type, the prefix of the functions and the parent GType to
      reduce the amount of boilerplate needed. This macro will:

    <para>
      If the class has been declared as final using
      <function>G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE</function> (see
      <xref linkend="howto-gobject-header"/>), private data should be placed in
      the instance structure, <type>ViewerFile</type>, and
      <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE</function> should be used instead of
      <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE</function>. The instance structure
      for a final class is not exposed publicly, and is not embedded in the
      instance structures of any derived classes (because the class is final);
      so its size can vary without causing incompatibilities for code which uses
      the class. Conversely, private data for derivable classes
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be included in a private structure, and
      <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE</function> must be used.

      It is also possible to use the
      <function>G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE</function> macro to control the
      <function>get_type</function> function implementation — for instance, to
      add a call to the <function>G_IMPLEMENT_INTERFACE</function> macro to
      implement an interface.

  <sect1 id="howto-gobject-construction">
    <title>Object construction</title>

    <para>
      People often get confused when trying to construct their GObjects because of the
      sheer number of different ways to hook into the objects's construction process: it is
      difficult to figure which is the <emphasis>correct</emphasis>, recommended way.
    </para>

    <para>
      <xref linkend="gobject-construction-table"/> shows what user-provided functions
      are invoked during object instantiation and in which order they are invoked.
      A user looking for the equivalent of the simple C++ constructor function should use
      the <function>instance_init</function> method. It will be invoked after
      all the parents’ <function>instance_init</function>
      functions have been invoked. It cannot take arbitrary construction parameters 
      (as in C++) but if your object needs arbitrary parameters to complete initialization,
      you can use construction properties.
    </para>

    <para>
      Construction properties will be set only after all
      <function>instance_init</function> functions have run.
      No object reference will be returned to the client of <function><link linkend="g-object-new">g_object_new</link></function>
      until all the construction properties have been set.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is important to note that object construction cannot <emphasis>ever</emphasis>
      fail. If you require a fallible GObject construction, you can use the
      <link linkend="GInitable"><type>GInitable</type></link> and
      <link linkend="GAsyncInitable"><type>GAsyncInitable</type></link>
      interfaces provided by the GIO library.
    </para>

    <para>
      You should write the following code first:
<informalexample><programlisting>
G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (ViewerFile, viewer_file, G_TYPE_OBJECT)

static void
viewer_file_class_init (ViewerFileClass *klass)
{
}

static void
viewer_file_init (ViewerFile *self)
{
  ViewerFilePrivate *priv = viewer_file_get_instance_private (self);

  /* initialize all public and private members to reasonable default values.
   * They are all automatically initialized to 0 to begin with. */
}
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      If you need special construction properties (with
      <link linkend="G-PARAM-CONSTRUCT-ONLY:CAPS"><function>G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY</function></link>
      set), install the properties in
      the <function>class_init()</function> function, override the <function>set_property()</function>
      and <function>get_property()</function> methods of the GObject class,
      and implement them as described by <xref linkend="gobject-properties"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Property IDs must start from 1, as 0 is reserved for internal use by
      GObject.
<informalexample><programlisting>
enum
{
  PROP_FILENAME = 1,
  PROP_ZOOM_LEVEL,
  N_PROPERTIES
};

static GParamSpec *obj_properties[N_PROPERTIES] = { NULL, };

viewer_file_class_init (ViewerFileClass *klass)
{
  GObjectClass *object_class = G_OBJECT_CLASS (klass);

  object_class->set_property = viewer_file_set_property;
  object_class->get_property = viewer_file_get_property;

  obj_properties[PROP_FILENAME] =
    g_param_spec_string ("filename",
                         "Filename",
                         "Name of the file to load and display from.",
                         NULL  /* default value */,
                         G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE));

  obj_properties[PROP_ZOOM_LEVEL] =
    g_param_spec_uint ("zoom-level",
                       "Zoom level",
                       "Zoom level to view the file at.",
                       0  /* minimum value */,

</programlisting></informalexample>
      If you need this, make sure you can build and run code similar to the
      code shown above. Also, make sure your construct properties can be set
      without side effects during construction.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some people sometimes need to complete the initialization of a instance
      of a type only after the properties passed to the constructors have been
      set. This is possible through the use of the <function>constructor()</function>
      class method as described in <xref linkend="gobject-instantiation"/> or,
      more simply, using the <function>constructed()</function> class method.
      Note that the <function>constructed()</function>
      virtual function will only be invoked after the properties marked as
      <function>G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY</function> or
      <function>G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT</function> have been consumed, but
      before the regular properties passed to <function>g_object_new()</function>
      have been set.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="howto-gobject-destruction">
    <title>Object destruction</title>

    <para>
      Again, it is often difficult to figure out which mechanism to use to
      hook into the object's destruction process: when the last
      <function><link linkend="g-object-unref">g_object_unref</link></function>
      function call is made, a lot of things happen as described in
      <xref linkend="gobject-destruction-table"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The destruction process of your object is in two phases: dispose and
      finalize. This split is necessary to handle
      potential cycles due to the nature of the reference counting mechanism
      used by GObject, as well as dealing with temporary revival of
      instances in case of signal emission during the destruction sequence.
      See <xref linkend="gobject-memory-cycles"/> for more information.

      It is possible that object methods might be invoked after dispose is
      run and before finalize runs. GObject does not consider this to be a

      warn the user, by having a disposed instance revert to an inert state.

      <para>
        These are very similar to <link linkend="virtual-public-methods">virtual
        public methods</link>. They just don't
        have a public function to call directly. The header
        file contains only a declaration of the virtual function:
<informalexample><programlisting>
/* declaration in viewer-file.h. */
struct _ViewerFileClass
{
  GObjectClass parent;

  /* Public virtual method as before. */
  void     (*open)           (ViewerFile  *self,
                              GError     **error);

  /* Private helper function to work out whether the file can be loaded via
   * memory mapped I/O, or whether it has to be read as a stream. */
  gboolean (*can_memory_map) (ViewerFile *self);

  /* Padding to allow adding up to 12 new virtual functions without
   * breaking ABI. */
  gpointer padding[12];
};

void viewer_file_open (ViewerFile *self, GError **error);
</programlisting></informalexample>
        These virtual functions are often used to delegate part of the job
        to child classes:
<informalexample><programlisting>
/* this accessor function is static: it is not exported outside of this file. */
static gboolean 
viewer_file_can_memory_map (ViewerFile *self)
{
  return VIEWER_FILE_GET_CLASS (self)->can_memory_map (self);
}

void
viewer_file_open (ViewerFile  *self,
                  GError     **error)
{
  g_return_if_fail (VIEWER_IS_FILE (self));
  g_return_if_fail (error == NULL || *error == NULL);

  /*
   * Try to load the file using memory mapped I/O, if the implementation of the
   * class determines that is possible using its private virtual method.
   */
  if (viewer_file_can_memory_map (self))
    {
      /* Load the file using memory mapped I/O. */
    }
  else
    {
      /* Fall back to trying to load the file using streaming I/O… */
    }
}
</programlisting></informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        Again, it is possible to provide a default implementation for this
        private virtual function:
<informalexample><programlisting>
static gboolean
viewer_file_real_can_memory_map (ViewerFile *self)
{
  /* As an example, always return false. Or, potentially return true if the
   * file is local. */
  return FALSE;
}

static void
viewer_file_class_init (ViewerFileClass *klass)
{
  /* non-pure virtual method; does not have to be implemented in children. */
  klass->can_memory_map = viewer_file_real_can_memory_map;
}
</programlisting></informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        Derived classes can then override the method with code such as:
<informalexample><programlisting>
static void
viewer_audio_file_class_init (ViewerAudioFileClass *klass)
{
  ViewerFileClass *file_class = VIEWER_FILE_CLASS (klass);

  /* implement pure virtual function. */
  file_class->can_memory_map = viewer_audio_file_can_memory_map;
}

  <sect1 id="howto-gobject-chainup">
    <title>Chaining up</title>
    
    <para>Chaining up is often loosely defined by the following set of
    conditions:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Parent class A defines a public virtual method named <function>foo</function> and 
        provides a default implementation.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>B’s implementation of <function>foo</function> calls (‘chains up to’) its parent class A’s implementation of <function>foo</function>.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      There are various uses of this idiom:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>You need to extend the behaviour of a class without modifying its code. You create
          a subclass to inherit its implementation, re-implement a public virtual method to modify the behaviour

          </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>You need to implement the

          each handler is run in turn.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      To explicitly chain up to the implementation of the virtual method in the parent class, 
      you first need a handle to the original parent class structure. This pointer can then be used to 
      access the original virtual function pointer and invoke it directly.
      <footnote>
        <para>
          The <emphasis>original</emphasis> adjective used in this sentence is not innocuous. To fully 
          understand its meaning, recall how class structures are initialized: for each object type,
          the class structure associated with this object is created by first copying the class structure of its
          parent type (a simple <function>memcpy</function>) and then by invoking the <function>class_init</function> callback on
          the resulting class structure. Since the <function>class_init</function> callback is responsible for overwriting the class structure
          with the user re-implementations of the class methods, the modified copy of the parent class
          structure stored in the derived instance cannot be used. A copy of the class structure of an instance of the parent
          class is needed.

    <para>
      To specify that an interface requires the presence of other interfaces
      when implemented, GObject introduces the concept of
      <emphasis>prerequisites</emphasis>: it is possible to associate
      a list of prerequisite types to an interface. For example, if
      object A wishes to implement interface I1, and if interface I1 has a
      prerequisite on interface I2, A has to implement both I1 and I2.
    </para>
  
    <para>
      The mechanism described above is, in practice, very similar to
      Java's interface I1 extends interface I2. The example below shows
      the GObject equivalent:
<informalexample><programlisting>
/* Make the ViewerEditableLossy interface require ViewerEditable interface. */
G_DEFINE_INTERFACE (ViewerEditableLossy, viewer_editable_lossy, VIEWER_TYPE_EDITABLE)
</programlisting></informalexample>
      In the <function><link linkend="G-DEFINE-INTERFACE:CAPS">G_DEFINE_INTERFACE</link></function>
      call above, the third parameter defines the prerequisite type. This
      is the GType of either an interface or a class. In this case
      the <type>ViewerEditable</type> interface is a prerequisite of
      <type>ViewerEditableLossy</type>. The code
      below shows how an implementation can implement both interfaces and
      register their implementations:
<informalexample><programlisting>
static void
viewer_file_editable_lossy_compress (ViewerEditableLossy *editable)
{
  ViewerFile *self = VIEWER_FILE (editable);

  g_print ("File implementation of lossy editable interface compress method: %s.\n",

      It is very important to notice that the order in which interface
      implementations are added to the main object is not random:
      <function><link linkend="g-type-add-interface-static">g_type_add_interface_static</link></function>,
      which is called by
      <function><link linkend="G-DEFINE-INTERFACE:CAPS">G_IMPLEMENT_INTERFACE</link></function>,
      must be invoked first on the interfaces which have no prerequisites and then on

  <sect1 id="howto-interface-properties">
    <title>Interface properties</title>

      GObject interfaces can also have
      properties. Declaration of the interface properties is similar to
      declaring the properties of ordinary GObject types as explained in
      <xref linkend="gobject-properties"/>, except that
      <function><link linkend="g-object-interface-install-property">g_object_interface_install_property</link></function>

    <para>
      To include a property named 'autosave-frequency' of type <type>gdouble</type> in the 
      <type>ViewerEditable</type> interface example code above, we only need to
      add one call in <function>viewer_editable_default_init</function> as shown
      below:
<informalexample><programlisting>

}
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
  
    <para>
      One point worth noting is that the declared property wasn't assigned an 
      integer ID. The reason being that integer IDs of properties are used
      only inside the <function>get_property</function> and
      <function>set_property</function> virtual methods. Since interfaces

      An implementation declares and defines its properties in the usual
      way as explained in <xref linkend="gobject-properties"/>, except for one
      small change: it can declare the properties of the interface it
      implements using <function><link linkend="g-object-class-override-property">g_object_class_override_property</link></function>
      instead of <function><link linkend="g-object-class-install-property">g_object_class_install_property</link></function>.
      The following code snippet shows the modifications needed in the
      <type>ViewerFile</type> declaration and implementation above:

      If a base class already implements an interface and a derived

  <title>How to create and use signals</title>

  <para>
    The signal system in GType is pretty complex and
    flexible: it is possible for its users to connect at runtime any
    number of callbacks (implemented in any language for which a binding
    exists)
    <footnote>
      <para>A Python callback can be connected to any signal on any
      C-based GObject, and vice versa, assuming that the Python object
      inherits from GObject.</para>
    </footnote>
    to any signal and to stop the emission of any signal at any 
    state of the signal emission process. This flexibility makes it
    possible to use GSignal for much more than just emitting signals to
    multiple clients.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="howto-simple-signals">
    <title>Simple use of signals</title>

    <para>
      The most basic use of signals is to implement event
      notification. For example, given a <type>ViewerFile</type> object with
      a <function>write</function> method, a signal could be emitted whenever
      the file is changed using that method.
      The code below shows how the user can connect a callback to the
      "changed" signal.
<informalexample><programlisting>
file = g_object_new (VIEWER_FILE_TYPE, NULL);

g_signal_connect (file, "changed", (GCallback) changed_event, NULL);

viewer_file_write (file, buffer, strlen (buffer));
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The <type>ViewerFile</type> signal is registered in the
      <function>class_init</function> function:
<informalexample><programlisting>
file_signals[CHANGED] = 
  g_signal_newv ("changed",
                 G_TYPE_FROM_CLASS (object_class),
                 G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST | G_SIGNAL_NO_RECURSE | G_SIGNAL_NO_HOOKS,
                 NULL /* closure */,
                 NULL /* accumulator */,
                 NULL /* accumulator data */,
                 NULL /* C marshaller */,
                 G_TYPE_NONE /* return_type */,
                 0     /* n_params */,
                 NULL  /* param_types */);
</programlisting></informalexample>
      and the signal is emitted in <function>viewer_file_write</function>:
<informalexample><programlisting>
void
viewer_file_write (ViewerFile   *self,
                   const guint8 *buffer,
                   gsize         size)
{
  g_return_if_fail (VIEWER_IS_FILE (self));
  g_return_if_fail (buffer != NULL || size == 0);

  /* First write data. */

  /* Then, notify user of data written. */
  g_signal_emit (self, file_signals[CHANGED], 0 /* details */);
}
</programlisting></informalexample>
      As shown above, the details parameter can safely be set to zero if no
      detail needs to be conveyed. For a discussion of what it can be used for,
      see <xref linkend="signal-detail"/>
    </para>

    <para>
      The C signal marshaller should always be <literal>NULL</literal>, in which
      case the best marshaller for the given closure type will be chosen by
      GLib. This may be an internal marshaller specific to the closure type, or
      <function>g_cclosure_marshal_generic</function>, which implements generic
      conversion of arrays of parameters to C callback invocations. GLib used to
      require the user to write or generate a type-specific marshaller and pass
      that, but that has been deprecated in favour of automatic selection of
      marshallers.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that <function>g_cclosure_marshal_generic</function> is slower than
      non-generic marshallers, so should be avoided for performance critical
      code. However, performance critical code should rarely be using signals
      anyway, as emitting a signal blocks on emitting it to all listeners, which
      has potentially unbounded cost.
