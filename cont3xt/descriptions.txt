    * otherwise it can be an object with
      * label - the field label to show the user
      * field - the path (it can have dots) to the data for field, if not set the field is the same as name. For table type this will be the path to the array.

      * type - if not set it is string
        * string - obvious
        * url - a url that should be made clickable

      * filterEmpty - for arrays/tables, removes empty (nullish & empty string/array) rows/elements when true (default is true)
      * defaultSortField - with array, sorts the table by this field
      * defaultSortDirection - with array and defaultSortField, sorts the table in this direction ('asc' or 'desc')

Tidbit Description - an object of the following
  * order - the default order to apply to all fields
  * fields - an array of the following objects (used for specifying tidbit UI)
    * label - the field label to show the user. If set, this will cause the tidbit to be shown as a key-value pair at the bottom of the display.
    * field - the path (it can have dots) to the data for field, if not set the field is the same as name. For table type this will be the path to the array.

      * seconds - a second time value
      * json - just display raw json, call in JSON.stringify(blah, false, 2)
    * fieldRoot - for arrays, the path (it can have dots) from each object in the array to its desired field. Effectively maps the root array of objects to an array of values/sub-objects.
    * template - string used to create display value with pseudo string-interpolation (applied before postProcess)
      * string with angle brackets surrounding paths (they can have dots) that are replaced by the data at that path (starting at value [the field] or data [entire data object]). Example: 'one value: <value> and two value: <data.something.otherValue>'
    * postProcess - optional string or array of strings that identify filters to be applied to value before display
    * tooltip - the string to display as the tooltip
    * tooltipTemplate - pseudo string-interpolation string used to generate tooltip

      * cont3xtField - clickable field with options: "copy", "pivot"

    * order - number by which tidbits are sorted (ascending order), default 0
    * purpose - optional, string to identify the purpose of a tidbit when the same information can be provided by more than one source. When multiple valid tidbits have the same purpose, only the one with the highest precedence will be kept
    * precedence - order of preference as a number, where a higher precedence level makes a data-source more preferred for the given purpose
