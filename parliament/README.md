# Arkime Parliament

Arkime Parliament is a [Vue.js][vue] web app to view and monitor multiple Arkime clusters.

This project was generated with [Vue CLI][vuecli].

## What is Parliament and how can I use it?

The Parliament dashboard contains a grouped list of your Arkime clusters with links, ES health, and issues for each. You can search for Arkimes in your Parliament, change the data refresh time (15 seconds is the default), and hover over issues and ES health statuses for more information.

#### Parliament Page
The main Parliament page allows any user in the users database to view Arkimes in your Parliament. If a user has a `parliamentUser` or `parliamentAdmin` role assigned they can interact with the Arkimes in your Parliament. These users can acknowledge and ignore issues for each cluster. A user with a `parliamentAdmin` role assigned can also update the Parliament when in **Edit Mode**. To enter this mode, toggle the switch on the top right (below the navbar). Now you can add, update, delete, or reorder groups and clusters in your Parliament.

#### Issues Page
The issues page contains a list of issues that your Parliament is experiencing. Here, you can ignore, acknowledge, and remove acknowledged issues if you are a `parliamentUser`.

Acknowledged issues will not show up on the main Parliament page, but will remain here (but grayed out) to be removed (via the trashcan button or waiting 15 minutes for them to be removed automatically).

Ignored issues will not show up on the main Parliament page, but will remain here (but grayed out) to be unignored (via the ignore dropdown button or automatically after the set ignore time has expired).

#### Settings Page
If you are a `parliamentAdmin`, you can view and edit the Parliament settings. The settings page has 3 sections as described below:

**General:** this section has a few settings that pertain to issues in your Parliament.
1. The `capture nodes must check in this often` setting controls how behind a node's cluster's timestamp can be from the current time. If the timestamp exceeds this time setting, an `Out Of Date` issue is added to the cluster. _The default for this setting is 30 seconds._
2. The `Elasticsearch query timeout` setting controls the maximum Elasticsearch status query duration. If the query exceeds this time setting, an `ES Down` issue is added to the cluster. _The default for this setting is 5 seconds._
3. The `Low Packets Threshold` setting controls the minimum number of packets that the capture node must receive. If the capture node is not receiving enough packets, a `Low Packets` issue is added to the cluster. You can set this value to `-1` to ignore this issue altogether. This setting also includes a time range for how long this problem must persist before adding an issue to the cluster. _The default for this setting is 0 packets for 10 seconds._
4. The `remove all issues after` setting controls when an issue is removed if it has not occurred again. The issue is removed from the cluster after this time expires as long as the issue has not occurred again. _The default for this setting is 60 minutes._
5. The `remove acknowledged issues after` setting controls when an acknowledged issue is removed. The issue is removed from the cluster after this time expires (so you don't have to remove issues manually with the trashcan button). _The default for this setting is 15 minutes._

**Auth (v4):** Here you can configure Parliament access using the Arkime User's database. See the [Arkime User Authentication](#arkime-user-authentication) section for more information.

**Notifiers:** this section provides the ability to configure alerts for your Parliament. Users can be alerted via:
1. Slack
2. Twilio
3. Email

Each different notifier can alert on different types of issues.


## Running from RPM/DEB
If using a prepackaged version of Arkime, use "Configure --parliament" to setup.  It will use port 8008 by default.

It is meant to sit behind a reverse proxy such as apache, with config like the following added.
```
ProxyPassMatch   ^/$ http://localhost:8008/parliament retry=0
ProxyPass        /parliament/ http://localhost:8008/parliament/ retry=0
```


### Install Dependencies

The app uses dependencies that are all bundled and minified using [webpack][webpack] via `npm run build`. This compiles the application into an output directory, in this case `parliament/vueapp/dist`. This is done automatically when starting the application with `npm start`.

The app uses a number of node.js tools for initialization. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/][node].

* We get dependencies via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

In the parliament app directory, execute:

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have a new folder:

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the dependencies


### Run the Application

#### Production

To start the app for production, simply run:
```
npm start -s -- -c ./absolute/path/to/config.ini
```
This command starts the app and passes in the config file location. It also bundles the application files into the `parliament/vueapp/dist` folder.

_**Important**: when using `npm start` the leading `--`, before the parameters is essential._

You can also run the app by building then starting the app. Like so:
* Move to the top level Arkime directory
* run `npm run parliament:build`
* Move to the parliament directory
* run ` node server.js -c ./absolute/path/to/config.ini`

**The parameters are defined as follows:**

| Parameter       | Default | Description |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| -c, --config    | /opt/arkime/etc/parliament.ini | Path to the config file |
| --port          | 8008    |  **Deprecated!** Must supply this in the config file (see arkime.com/settings#parliament). Port for the web app to listen on. |
| --key           | EMPTY   | **Deprecated!** Must supply this in the config file (see arkime.com/settings#parliament). Private certificate to use for https, if not set then http will be used. **certfile** must also be set. |
| --cert          | EMPTY   | **Deprecated!** Must supply this in the config file (see arkime.com/settings#parliament). Public certificate to use for https, if not set then http will be used. **keyFile** must also be set. |

_**Important**: Upgrading from v4 to v5 requires port/key/cert parameters to be included in the config file, not supplied as command line arguments!_

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8008` (or whichever port you included in the config file).

#### Arkime User Authentication
You can configure Parliament access using the Auth section on the Settings page (v4) or the config file (v5). Auth uses the Arkime User's database for Parliament access.

_**Note**: When upgrading form v4 to v5, Auth settings configured in the UI will be automatically transferred to the config file._

- **All** Arkime users can view the Parliament.
- Users with the "parliamentUser" role can ack, ignore, and delete issues within the Parliament.
- Users with the "parliamentAdmin" role can do everything a "parliamentUser" can, plus they can configure the Parliament by adding/removing/updating groups/clusters and manage the Parliament settings.

#### Development

To start the app for development and testing:
* Move to the top level Arkime directory
* run `npm run parliament:dev`

This command starts the app with the necessary config options set (`-c ../parliament/parliament.ini`) and bundles the unminified application files into the `parliament/vueapp/dist` folder.

`npm run parliament:dev` uses webpack to package the files then watches for changes to relevant files, and re-bundles the app after each save.

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8008`.

### Parliament Definition
`parliament.json` (or whatever you supply as `file=` in the config when starting Parliament) is the file that describes your parliament. You can create this by hand or use the Parliament UI to create, edit, and delete groups and clusters. View the supplied `parliament.example.json` to view an example parliament configuration.

### Issues
`parliament.issues.json` will be created to store issues pertaining to the clusters in your parliament.
