 * This product includes software developed by the University of Michigan,
 * Merit Network, Inc., and their contributors.
 *
 * This file had been called "radix.c" in the MRT sources.
 *
 * I renamed it to "patricia.c" since it's not an implementation of a general
 * radix trie.  Also I pulled in various requirements from "prefix.c" and
 * "demo.c" so that it could be used as a standalone API.
