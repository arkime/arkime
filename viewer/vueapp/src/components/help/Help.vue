          Most Arkime tabs have a search bar at the top of the page.
          Arkime uses a simple query language for building searches.
        </p>
        <h6 id="basic">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          Basic Query
        </h6>
        <p>
          Searches are done using field names, operators, and values.
          This is sometimes also called a search expression. (e.g. <code>ip.src == 1.2.3.4</code>)

          Time Range
        </h6>
        <p>
          All queries require a start and stop time range, set from either the relative time drop down or by entering an exact time.
          Relative times are recalculated for each new query performed.
          Entering an exact time will automatically switch from a relative time range to a fixed time range.
          Next to the start/stop entries are buttons that will quickly take you to the start/stop of each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since every session has a first packet, last packet, and database timestamp, Arkime offers
          a choice on how it matches sessions:
        </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>First Packet</dt>
          <dd>The timestamp of the first packet received for the session.</dd>
          <dt>Last Packet</dt>
          <dd>The timestamp of the last packet received for the session.</dd>
          <dt>Bounded</dt>
          <dd>Both the first and last packet timestamps for the session must be inside the time window.</dd>
          <dt>Session Overlaps</dt>
          <dd>The timestamp of the first packet must be before the end of the time window AND the timestamp of the last packet must be after the start of the time window.</dd>
          <dt>Database</dt>
          <dd>The timestamp the session was written to the database.  This can be up to several minutes AFTER the last packet was received.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The Interval drop down allows you to control how much time each column/point in the graph represents.
          The auto setting will change the bucket sized based on the time range selected.

      <div class="ml-4">
        <h6 id="stringSearch">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          String Search
        </h6>
        <p>
          In Arkime, string fields are special since they can be searched in several different ways.
          When fields are indexed, their case may or may not be normalized, which is documented in the
          <a href="help#fields" class="no-decoration">fields table below</a>.
          The types of string searches are:
        </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Wildcard</dt>
          <dd>
            If a <code>*</code> appears in a expression, it is assumed a wildcard
            match is being used. Supported wildcards are <code>*</code>, which
            matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and
            <code>?</code>, which matches any single character. The wildcard query
            is run against the full text strings, after case normalization if
            enabled for the field. For example
            <code>http.uri == "www.f*k.com"</code> will capture an http.uri string
            which contains either www.fork.com or www.frack.com.
          </dd>
          <dt>Regex</dt>
          <dd>
            A regex query must be surrounded by forward slashes and will always be
            anchored. This means you will almost always want to include a leading
            and trailing <code>.*</code> within your regex query. The regex query
            is run against the full text strings, after case normalization (if enabled) for the field.
            For example <code>http.uri == /.*www\.f.*k\.com.*/</code>. It uses the
            Lucene regex implementation which doesn't support most PCRE features.
            Check out the ES <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/regexp-syntax.html">Regexp Syntax</a> guide.
          </dd>
          <dt>OR Lists</dt>
          <dd>
            In Arkime, OR Lists are used as a shorthand method for doing multiple OR queries.
            A list containing wildcard or regex strings will process as wildcard/regexes.
            For example instead of <code>(protocols == http || protocols == s*)</code> use <code>protocols == [http,s*]</code>.
            This query will search for any sessions where the protocols field contains either the exact 'http' value OR values starting with 's'.
            Using an OR List many times can be faster for the system to process than using <code>||</code>.
          </dd>
          <dt>AND Lists</dt>
          <dd>
            In Arkime, AND Lists are used as a shorthand method for doing multiple AND queries.
            A list containing wildcard or regex strings will process as wildcard/regexes.
            For example instead of <code>(protocols == http &amp;&amp; protocols == s*)</code> use <code>protocols == ]http,s*[</code>.
            This query will search for any sessions where the protocols field contains both the exact 'http' value AND a value starting with 's'.
            Using an AND List many times can be faster for the system to process than using <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <h6 id="ipSearch">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          IP Search
        </h6>
        <p>
          IP searching is very flexible and can be performed using the full IP
          address, a partial IP address, or CIDR representation. For fields
          that include a port number, it is possible to follow any of the IP
          representations with a colon (ip4) or dot (ip6) and then the port number to further refine a query. Ports are also
          first class searchable and may be searched for directly. For example:
          <code>ip == 1.2.3.0/24:80</code>. This query will search for all sessions which contain an IP address within the 1.2.3.0/24 CIDR range as well as utilizing port 80 during the session.
          An IP search can also be done with list of IPs which may be in mixed representations, both OR Lists and AND Lists are supported: <code>ip == [1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8,1.3.0.0/16]</code>
          If you only want to find ipv4 or ipv6 traffic, you can search using those tokens: <code>ip.src == ipv6</code>
        </p>
        <h6 id="numericSearch">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          Numeric Search
        </h6>
        <p>
          Numeric fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
          and not equals query types. For example, to show events with bytes transferred being less than 10000,
          use this query: <code>bytes &lt;= 10000</code>.
          Numeric fields also support both OR Lists and AND Lists. For example, <code>port == [80,443,23]</code>
        </p>
        <h6 id="dateSearch">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          Date Search
        </h6>
        <p>
          Date fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
          and not equals. For example: <code>starttime == "2004/07/31 05:33:41"</code>.
          They also support both OR Lists and AND Lists for a simple OR/AND queries. For example:
          <code>stoptime == ["2004/07/31 05:33:41","2004/07/31 06:33:41"]</code>.
          However, usually it's much easier to use the
          <a href="help#timebounding" class="no-decoration">time bounding</a>
          controls under the search bar.
          <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>, using starttime or stoptime does <strong>NOT</strong>
          change the overall <a href="help#timebounding" class="no-decoration">time bounding</a>
          of the query.
          Finally, relative dates and optional snapping are supported using the
          Splunk syntax:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Begin the string with a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate the offset from
            the current time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define the time amount with a number and a unit.
            The supported time units are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>second:</strong> s, sec, secs, second, seconds
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>minute:</strong> m, min, minute, minutes
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>hour:</strong> h, hr, hrs, hour, hours
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>day:</strong> d, day, days
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>week:</strong> w, week, weeks
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>month:</strong> mon, month, months
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>quarter:</strong> q, qtr, qtrs, quarter, quarters
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>year:</strong> y, yr, yrs, year, years
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, specify a "snap to" time unit that indicates the nearest
            or latest time to which the time amount rounds down. Separate the time
            amount from the "snap to" time unit with an "@" character.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6 id="fieldExistsSearch">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          Field Exists Search
        </h6>
        <p>
          It is possible to check if a field has been set or not in the session by
          using the special comparison value of <code>field == EXISTS!</code> OR negated: <code>field != EXISTS!</code>.
          For example, to verify that a certificate doesn't have an issuer common name, but does
          have a issuer organizational name, the follow query could be used:
          <code>cert.issuer.cn != EXISTS! &amp;&amp; cert.issuer.on == EXISTS!</code>
        </p>
        <h6 id="examples">
          <span class="fa fa-search"></span>&nbsp;
          Examples
        </h6>
        <p>
          Find all the sessions involving Russia (RU) or China (CN) that are
          using port 80 and also a hostname which contains "com":
          <pre>
            (country == RU || country == CN) &amp;&amp; port == 80 &amp;&amp; host == *com
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Find all the sessions of type "text/plain", involving Canada (CA), and
          containing less than 20 packets:
          <pre>
            <code>tags == "http:content:text/plain" &amp;&amp; country == CA &amp;&amp; packets &lt; 20</code>
          </pre>

          Sessions table

        <p>
          Now we arrive at the meat of the Sessions page... Our Session Data! Before we drill into what can be observed within the sessions data, please take note of the column configuration ( <span class="fa fa-th"></span> ) button. By clicking this button an analyst may select
          any field that they wish to observe without opening a session fully by adding it as a column to the table. Predictive typing is also applied within this box. Example: An analyst is only investigating suspicious IRC sessions via the analyst's search query. Instead of drilling into each
          session, that analyst has decided to only show the Start Time, End Time, Src IP, Src Port, Dst IP, Dst Pot, IRC Channel, and IRC Nickname. This column selection tool allows for an analyst to readily view the information which is important to them, configurable per investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Tip:</strong>
            An analyst can save or load previously saved column configurations by clicking the save/load column configuration
            ( <span class="fa fa-columns"></span> ) button.
          </em>
        </p>

          Hover over a column header and click the column action ( <span class="fa fa-caret-down"></span> ) button to do a few things:
          <ol>
            <li>Hide the column from the table</li>
            <li>Export the column values</li>
            <li>Export the column values with counts</li>
            <li>Open the SPI Graph page with that field (see the <a href="help#spigraph">SPI Graph</a> section for more details)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Viewing the sessions data of a specific network session is as easy as clicking the plus ( <span class="fa fa-plus"></span> ) button to the left of every session. Upon clicking the button, the session drawer will expand giving further context to the session.
          All packet data which was parsed will now be displayed. This includes everything from the user making the connection to the TCP Flags observed during the session.
          If the sessions is HTTP based further data such as Method, User Agents, and Response Headers are readily observable. The extracted Request and Response packet text will also be readily available in either a natural, ascii, utf8, or hex format.
          Furthermore, an analyst can uncompress response data as well as image files which were transferred during the session (be cautious with this option click if investigating sensitive images). Other files (such as mp3s, swf, or js files) may be clicked so that
          they may be downloaded and analyzed when necessary.

        SPI View
      </h3>
      <p>
        The SPI (Session Profile Information) View is used to dive into specific metrics of a session which an analyst wishes to investigate further. Instead of manually writing a query,
        an analyst can hover over field values within the SPI View to add the specific item as an AND or AND NOT to their query. This page also allows an
        analyst a quick view into counts of each item that the user is interested in. As an example, if an analyst wanted to see all BASIC authorization headers that have been recorded
        over the current time window, an analyst could open the http drawer and click to enable the http.authorization field. The analyst could then update their search query to either
        include a specific authorization string which has been observed, or use a wildcard to see all of a certain type of authorization header (Basic *, BEARER *, etc). Additionally,
        the SPI View allows an analyst a quick view of observed IP addresses within the time window, http response codes, IRC NICKs/Channels, and much, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>
        The analyst can save or load the fields that they have displayed/hidden on the SPI View page by clicking the save/load field configuration
        ( <span class="fa fa-columns"></span> ) button.

        SPI Graph
      </h3>
      <p>
        The SPI Graph page allows a user to visualize, via bar charts over time, any item within the SPI View page. This page is very useful for both at a glance views of activity per SPI type,
        as well as deep dive analysis. For example, if you wanted to chart all of the currently recorded http.users within your current time window, select http.user from the SPI Graph selection typeahead.
        Data will be displayed based upon count of observances over the time period. Increasing the Max Elements setting will allow an analyst to see additional items if the investigated SPI type is noisy.
        An analyst can sort by either the noisiest value (graph) or by alphabetical order (name). This page also has the ability to update every X seconds.

      <p>
        This page also includes pie, table, and treemap views of the data. This data can be layered similar to the export intersection functionality in the action menu dropdown.
        This runs an aggregation of multiple unique fields and displays the data in the visualization of your choice.

        The Connections page allows a user to view a tree force graph based on a source node and destination node of their choosing. Relationships may be visually determined using this method.
        For example, set your source node to ip.src, destination node to ip.dst:port and you will be able to visualize the relationship of source IP addresses to destination IP address / port combinations.
        Those who prefer to analyze session data visually may rely heavily on these graphs.

        Hunt
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Hunt page allows users to search within session packets for text.
        To perform a hunt, users should start by narrowing down their search on the Sessions page.
        Then, switch to the Hunt tab where any new hunt will only search within the sessions searched for earlier.
        Underneath the search bar, the Hunt page will display the number of sessions that will be searched.
        To begin your hunt, click on the "Create a packet search job" button on the top right of the page (under the search bar).
        The form that is presented is described below:
      </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal dl-horizontal-wide">
          <dt>Name</dt>
          <dd>The name of the hunt (multiple hunts can have the same name)</dd>
          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dd>The description of the hunt (useful when sharing)</dd>
          <dt>Max number of packets to examine per session</dt>
          <dd>The maximum number of packets that the hunt will search within each session</dd>
          <dt>Notify</dt>
          <dd>An optional notifier name to fire when there is an error, or there are matches (every 10 minutes), or when the hunt is complete.</dd>
          <dt>Search</dt>
          <dd>The text to search for (ascii, case sensitive ascii, hex, regex, or hex regex)</dd>
          <dt>Search src/dst packets</dt>
          <dd>Whether to search source or destination packets, or both. Must select at least one.</dd>
          <dt>Search raw/reassembled packets</dt>
          <dd>Whether to search raw or reassembled packets</dd>
          <dt>Roles</dt>
          <dd>The roles that can view the results.</dd>
          <dt>Users</dt>
          <dd>A comma separated list of users to be added to the hunt so they can view the results.</dd>
        </dl>
      <p>
        Once the hunt has been created, it will be added to the <strong>hunt job queue</strong>. Hunts run one at a time and
        can be paused so that another hunt can run. After a hunt has completed, it will be added to
        the <strong>hunt job history</strong>. Here, you can rerun a hunt on a different set of sessions, open the
        sessions that matched the hunt, or delete the hunt job from the history. You can also cancel a hunt. This simply
        stops the packet searching and moves the hunt to the hunt history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hunts add <code>huntName</code> and <code>huntId</code> fields to the sessions as they match.
        You can search for these fields in the sessions search bar at any time. Deleting a hunt from the history
        does not remove these fields from the sessions. If there are matches and you have remove privileges, you
        can remove these fields by clicking the X button.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Info:</strong> A normal user can only view/pause/delete their own hunts, but an admin can view/pause/delete all hunts.<br>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> The packet search will take a long time and possibly slow down the viewer if you search many sessions.
        Users will be alerted if they are trying to search for more than 100,000 sessions. Normal users cannot search more than 1,000,000
        sessions, and admins cannot search more than 10,000,000 sessions (these values can be overwritten in the config).

          Shortcuts are lists of values that can be used in search queries.
          For example, create a list of IPs and use them in a query
          expression <code>ip.src == $MY_IPS</code>. Users can share
          shortcuts with specific users by listing each user's userId.
          Users can share shortcuts with multiple users by sharing to
          roles. For example, sharing with the "arkimeUser" role will share
          the shortcut with any user that has access to Arkime.
          <br>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>$</code> to autocomplete shortcuts
          in search expressions.
          <br>
          <strong>Note:</strong> If your clusters are configured with usersElasticsearch
          and cronQueries, shortcuts will sync across clusters and be available
          to use on all clusters that have access to the usersElasticsearch.

          Basic inheritance is supported for role, so if you create a 'team' role and assign it the cont3xtUser role,
          any user assigned the new 'team' role will also have the 'cont3xtUser' role assigned.
        </p>

        System Roles:
        <dl class="dl-horizontal dl-horizontal-wide">
          <dt>superAdmin</dt>
          <dd>Has all system roles assigned. Can only be assigned by another superAdmin. Users with superAdmin assigned are the only ones that can assign Admin roles to other users.</dd>
          <dt>usersAdmin</dt>
          <dd>Can use the Users page to add/modify/delete users, except superAdmin users. Users with usersAdmin assigned can unassign Admin roles, but not assign them to other users.</dd>
          <dt>arkimeAdmin</dt>
          <dd>Can perform Arkime configuration, view data for other Arkime users, and automatically assigned the arkimeUser role.</dd>
          <dt>arkimeUser</dt>
          <dd>Can use the Arkime viewer application</dd>
          <dt>cont3xtAdmin</dt>
